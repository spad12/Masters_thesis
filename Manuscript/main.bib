abstract = {The three-dimensional interaction of a magnetized, collisionless flowing plasma with a non-emitting conducting sphere is solved in the entire range of physically allowed parameters, in the ion-collecting regime. This can be considered as the "spherical Mach probe" problem, establishing how the ion flux to the surface varies with orientation and external velocity; the study is however of broader interest, as the sphere can also be seen as a dust particle or any ionospheric body. The core tool developed for this study is the fully parallelized (particle + field solver) Particle-In-Cell code SCEPTIC3D, three-dimensional evolution of SCEPTIC, accounting for the full ion distribution function and Boltzmann electrons. Investigations are first carried out in the quasineutral limit. Results include a report of ion current dependence on the external plasma parameters, as well as a theoretical calibration for transverse Mach probes with four electrodes oriented at 450 to the magnetic field in a plane of flow and magnetic field, valid for arbitrary temperature and ion magnetization. The analysis is preceded by an independent semi-analytic treatment of strongly magnetized ion collection by oblique surfaces, successfully validating SCEPTIC3D's behaviour.},

@phdthesis{Patacchini2007,
abstract = {The interaction between a probe and a plasma has been studied since the 1920s and the pioneering work of Mott-Smith and Langmuir [1], and is still today an active topic of experimental and theoretical research. Indeed an understanding of the current collection process by an electrode is relevant to diverse matters such as Langmuir and Mach-probes calibrations, dusty plasma physics, or spacecraft charging. Recent simulations relying on the ad hoc designed code SCEPTIC have fully addressed the collisionless and unmagnetized problem for a drifting collector idealized as a sphere. SCEPTIC is a 2d/3v hybrid Particle In Cell (PIC) code, in which the ion motion is fully resolved, while the electrons are treated as a Boltzmann distributed fluid [2, 3]. In the present work we tackle the transition between the unmagnetized and the weakly magnetized regime of ion collection by a spherical probe (The mean ion Larmor radius rL > rp) in a collisionless plasma (The ion mean free path Am,fp > rp). When the sphere is at space potential, we demonstrate that the ion current dependence on the background magnetic field B is linear for low B, and provide analytical expressions for this dependence. When the probe potential can not be neglected, the problem shows two distinct scale lengths: A collisionless layer of a few rp close to the probe, followed by a collisional presheath of a few AX,fp. The chosen approach is to resolve the collisionless scale-length with SCEPTIC, while using appropriate outer boundary conditions on the potential and ion distribution function to connect with the unresolved collisional presheath. We present results of our numerical simulations for a wide range of plasma parameters of direct relevance to Langmuir and Mach-probes.},
